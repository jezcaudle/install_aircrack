# install_aircrack
Script that installs Air Crack and the rtl8812au driver on a Raspberry Pi running Buster.

The script installs the required dependecies and then downloads the source code for Air Crack, compiles and installs it.

It then downloads, compiles and installs the driver for the rtl8812au.

Only tested on a Pi Zero W - YMMV
